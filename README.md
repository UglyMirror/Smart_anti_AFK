# Smart_anti_AFK
A smart anti AFK script

The abilities:
  Provides all the necessary actions to avoid afk induced kicks, namely random pressing of WASD buttons, shift and space, as well as both mouse buttons.
  All of these actions are picked randomly, as well as their duration.
  The script has the ability to constantly check for sudden changes in constant variables within your screen, a.e it detects sudden color changes, and if it does detect one, it automatically stops the execution of the script, as to not cause any damage (clicking things outside the game).

To use the script:
  Download the main.py file and run it. When you do so, a terminal in the bottom should open where you need to answer a couple of questions.
  After answering them, you are given 5 seconds to change windows into the game where the script will be executed.
